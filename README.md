# UwU Encrypter v1.0 by Pelda

UwU Encrypter is a simple, user-friendly application for hashing strings using the bcrypt algorithm that I made while bored at work.

I decided to **finally** make a decent readme file, there we have it.

## Features

- Generate a bcrypt salt
- Hash a string using a provided salt
- Copy the hashed string to the clipboard

## Usage

1. Run the `hasher.py` script to start the application.
2. Enter a salt in the salt field or click the "Generate Salt" button to generate a new salt.
3. Enter the string you want to hash in the string field.
4. Click the "Hash" button to hash the string.
5. The hashed string will appear in the result field.
6. Click the "Copy to Clipboard" button to copy the hashed string to the clipboard.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- bcrypt
- customtkinter
- pyperclip
- tkinter

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required Python packages using pip:
